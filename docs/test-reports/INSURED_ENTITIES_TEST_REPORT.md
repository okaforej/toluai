## 🐛 Issues Found & Solutions

### Issue 1: Navigation Selector
**Problem**: Tests fail to find `a[href="/insured-entities"]` with text "Insured Entities"
**Actual**: Link text is just "Insured"
**Solution**: Update selector to:
```javascript
page.click('text="Insured"')
// or
page.click('a:has-text("Insured")')
```

### Issue 2: Test Timeouts
**Problem**: Tests timeout waiting for elements
**Cause**: Page uses lazy loading and dynamic content
**Solution**: Add proper wait conditions:
```javascript
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
await page.waitForSelector('table', { timeout: 10000 });
```
